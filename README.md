So did the docs. Make sure to generate your own token for `lights_controller.py:` and to do `which python` in the `LIFX-controller` folder and use the copy paste the return after "#!". eg "#!/It/SHOULD/LOOK/LIKE/THIS/python". 

I included the a png that I used to make an icon using a menu editor. I also included the font I used but that stuff is optional

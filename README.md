Make sure to generate your own token for `lights_controller.py:7`. You may also do `which python` in the `LIFX-controller` folder(via terminal) and paste the output at `light_gui:1` after `#!`. eg `#!/It/SHOULD/LOOK/LIKE/THIS/python`. 

I included the .png that I used to as an icon using a menu editor. I also included the font I used but that stuff is optional.
